Quantum Storage
===============

*Quantum Storage* objects are used by the *Host* components. Each *Host* has two *Quantum Storage* objects,
one for EPR pairs and the other for data qubits, but in both cases, they store *Qubit* objects. As
further iterations of QuNetSim are developed, we plan to add parameters such that we can better simulate
quantum memories.
